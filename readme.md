# Notion + Next.js blog starter kit

This repository is a startup kit that allows you to create a blog using `notion` and `next.js`.<br/>

## ü§î How did you create Next.js + Notion?

When you write a post in Notion, a static page is automatically created using next.js' ISR method.

### Open sources used

Based on `transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit` and `2skydev/Notion-Next.js-blog-starter-kit`, I customized it and decorated it as I wanted.<br/>
There were many functions supported by default, but there were many parts that were left to be desired, so I customized them myself.

### Omniscient Notion point of view

Since a blog is created based on the contents of Notion, are you curious about how Notion is actually structured?<br/>
You can check the Notion structure of this blog through the link below!

## üîé I want to know more about how it works

The basic operation is to create a page using the `ISR` method of next.js.

Even after deployment (build), if you create or modify a page in Notion, it will be automatically reflected.

### Notion API?

The API for retrieving Notion information was not the official API, but the API requested from the actual Notion page.

Oh, of course, the comment function uses the Notion official API :)

### What happens if I create a new page in Notion after deployment (build)?

1. When accessing a newly created page, since no static page has been created, `router.isFallback` is activated and the loading effect is displayed.
2. In the `getStaticProps` function, retrieve all pages based on the Notion root page id.
3. Operation 2 creates a Notion site map object and checks whether the accessed address is in the site map (if not, 404 is processed)
4. If it is in the sitemap, page information is retrieved based on the Notion page ID that matches the address.
5. If the page information has been loaded, `router.isFallback` becomes false, the loading effect disappears, and a new static page is displayed.

### What happens if I modify the page in Notion after deployment (build)?

1. When accessing a modified page, the `getStaticProps` function returns `revalidate: 10`, and if 10 seconds have passed based on the last user accessing the page, the `getStaticProps` function is executed in the background (connected users will see the previous version of the page) )
2. In the `getStaticProps` function, retrieve all pages based on the Notion root page id.
3. Operation 2 creates a Notion site map object and checks whether the accessed address is in the site map (if not, 404 is processed)
4. If it is in the sitemap, page information is retrieved based on the Notion page ID that matches the address (latest version information)
5. If the page information is loaded, a static page is created, and users who have already connected will see the previous version of the page, but users who have connected later (including the refresh action of users who have already connected) will see the latest version of the created static page. displayed

## üöÄ I want to use this configuration too

After cloning the repo, [`Issue Notion API key`](https://github.com/2skydev/Notion-Next.js-blog-starter-kit/wiki/Notion-API-%ED%82%A4-%EB% B0%9C%EA%B8%89-&-%ED%99%98%EA%B2%BD-%EB%B3%80%EC%88%98-%EC%84%A4%EC%A0%95 ) and [`site.config.ts`](https://github.com/2skydev/Notion-Next.js-blog-starter-kit/wiki/site.config.ts) to use it immediately. <br/>
Please follow the steps below :)

### 1. Get a customized blog template

After downloading the repo using `Fork` or `Use this template`, you can use it without problem by following all the steps below.

[GitHub - 2skydev/blog](https://github.com/2skydev/blog)

### 2. Basic usage

The customized blog template is based on the open source below, so please check how to use it in the GitHub README.md.

[GitHub - transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit - setup](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/nextjs-notion-starter-kit#setup)

### 3. Matching Notion database view format

In order for the post list to appear according to the design, the database view form must have the same form and attribute order as mine.<br/>
If possible, please make the order of the form and properties match as shown in the link below.

[Notion - blog template](https://2skydev.notion.site/2skydev-blog-d1e89e9e42eb4ebf9486ae0374039efc)

> ‚ùóÔ∏è There is a strange loading phenomenon when using Notion‚Äôs ‚Äòduplicate‚Äô function.<br/>
> Notion pages used as blogs must be created directly, not ‚Äòduplicated‚Äô pages.

### 4. Replacement and removal of default files

The code you downloaded is already the blog source I am using, so there are unnecessary files and image files that need to be replaced.
The items are as follows.

1. Remove naver-site-verification file: `/public/naverXXXXXXXXXXX.html`
2. Change profile picture: `public/favicon-128x128.png`, `public/favicon-192x192.png`, `public/favicon.ico`, `public/favicon.png`
3. Change loading effect: `public/loading.gif`, `components/PageLoading.tsx`
4. Change site.config.ts: `rootNotionPageId`, `name`, `domain`, `author`, `description`, `defaultPageIcon`, `navigationLinks`, `enableComment`

### 5. Issuing Notion API key & setting environment variables

OG Image (social-image) and comment functions use the Notion API. Please go to the document link below and proceed to issue the key.
